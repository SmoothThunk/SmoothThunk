Hi there! I am Shriya, a student studying Math and Computer Science. 
I am interested in the study of Programming Languages and Verification, 
including their theory, semantics, design, and implementation, with a focus on types and type Systems.


In particular, I am interested in Functional languages and their type systems and am currently
working on dependently typed languages in order to one day extend it to support dependent-intersection types.

For some of of you who maybe new here, dependent-intersection types are a special way to encode a 
multitude of types namely inductive-inductive and inductive-recursive without changing the core of the
language. I am trying to see if there is a simple way to construct this type by extending plain old
sigma (or dependent) types. 

A thorough explanation with example of dependent intersection types is mentioned in the [pdf](https://github.com/SmoothThunk/SmoothThunk/files/14313438/Example_of_Dependent_Intersection_Types.pdf) attached

* In the functional realm, I have experience coding in Haskell, OCaml, and Ruby. 
* In the object oriented realm I have experience coding in C/C++, Python, and Java
* In the dependent realm I have experience with Coq (pronounced coke), Agda, and EasyCrypt.
