Hi there! I am Shriya, a student studying Math and Computer Science. I am interested in the study of programming languages, 
including their theory, semantics, design, and implementation, with a focus on Types. 
In particular, I am interested in Functional languages and their type systems and am currently hooked on Dependently Typed Languages.
I have experience coding in Haskell, Scheme, Ruby, Scala and in C/C++, Python.
